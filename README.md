This is a project that search for the similarity of trademark. A trademark is a very important sign for us to identify and distinguish the products or services from each other. It may be a word, phrase, symbol, sound, colour, or a combination of these designs. Hence, the aim of this project is to create an image search engine to do a similarity search for a trademark. The proposed trademark may cause some confusion or the percentage of similarity will be high when compared to the previous registered trademarks. It will be a very exhaustive work and time-consuming if humans look at all the images and other design characteristics and compare it with existing registered trademarks to determine its uniqueness. And it can be said it is an impossible task. So, we can use computer vision and a database that contains all of the active and inactive trademark registrations and applications for the searching process.
